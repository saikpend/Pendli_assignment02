# Saikiran Pendli

I have travelled to over multiple states in my country for travelling. My favourite one was Mumbai because they have a lot of delicious food.
I can speak four different languages: English, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi.
I was 23 when I got my first job at Amazon company, which helped me develop leadership, communication and listening skills.
My previous Manager would describe me as reliable since I regularly submitted high-quality work by their respective deadlines.
My favourite part about my job is pitching unique advertising campaign ideas that help small businesses stand out from competitors.
One of my main professional goals is to one day become a software developer.
